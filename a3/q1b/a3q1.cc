/* NOTES:

   MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS CODE DOES BEFORE TRYING TO WRITE TEST CASES.
  
   YOU SHOULD NOT NEED TO MODIFY THIS FILE.

   Commands are given in a regex style, e.g. saba, p a 3, f a, etc.
   Copy Constructor needs to work before operator* and operator+ can be tested.
   
   If you construct an iString in the heap, it is 
   YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO use the e command to delete the iString. Failure
   to do so will result in a memory leak and your test failing
   
   Note on commands: Spaces are not necessary but are used here for readability.
   All instances of source, source1, source2 and destination listed below are in the range [a-d].
   
   Command descriptions:
   s destination source1 source2 // operator+: destination = source1 + source2
   t destination source1 string  // operator+: destination = source1 + string
   r destination string          // operator>>: read a string into an iString object
   w source                      // operator<<: output the source iString object
   p destination source1         // operator~: concatenated prefixes of source1
   n destination string          // iString(char*): create an iString object with given string as contents
   i destination source          // copy constructor: copy an existing iString object (like strdup)
   = destination source          // assignment operator: copy an existing iString object
   f destination                 // default constructor: create empty iString (basically, empty string)
   e source                      // delete source: cleans up memory by calling destructor
   l source                      // print length of source iString
   c source                      // print capacity of source iString
   q/eof                         // terminates the test harness
